## Overview

isula-build is a container image build tool developed by the iSula container team. It allows you to quickly build container images using Dockerfiles.

The isula-build uses the server/client mode. The isula-build functions as a client and provides a group of command line tools for image build and management. The isula-builder functions as the server, processes client management requests, and functions as the daemon process in the background.

![isula-build architecture](./figures/isula-build_arch.png)

> **Note:**
>
> - Currently, isula-build supports OCI image format([OCI Image Format Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/spec.md)) and Docker image format([Image Manifest Version 2, Schema 2](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/)). Using command `export ISULABUILD_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL=enabled` to open the experimental feature for supporting OCI image format. When experimental feature is disabled, isula-build will take Docker image format as the default image format. Instead, isula-build will take OCI image format as the default image format.

## Installation

### Preparations

To ensure that isula-build can be successfully installed, the following software and hardware requirements must be met:

- Supported architectures: x86_64 and AArch64
- Supported OS: openEuler
- You have the permissions of the root user.

#### Installing isula-build

Before using isula-build to build a container image, you need to install the following software packages:

**(Recommended) Method 1: Using YUM**

1. Configure the openEuler yum source.

2. Log in to the target server as the root user and install isula-build.

   ```
   sudo yum install -y isula-build
   ```

**Method 2: Using the RPM Package**

1. Obtain the isula-build-*.rpm installation package from the openEuler yum source, for example, isula-build-0.9.6-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm.

2. Upload the obtained RPM software package to any directory on the target server, for example, /home/.

3. Log in to the target server as the root user and run the following command to install isula-build:

   ```
   sudo rpm -ivh /home/isula-build-*.rpm
   ```

> **Note:**
>
> - After the installation is complete, you need to manually start the isula-build service. For details about how to start the service, see "Managing the isula-build Service."

## Configuring and Managing the isula-build Service

### Configuring the isula-build Service

After the isula-build software package is installed, the systemd starts the isula-build service based on the default configuration contained in the isula-build software package on the isula-build server. If the default configuration file on the isula-build server cannot meet your requirements, perform the following operations to customize the configuration file: After the default configuration is modified, restart the isula-build server for the new configuration to take effect. For details, see "Managing the isula-build Service."

Currently, the isula-build server contains the following configuration file:

- /etc/isula-build/configuration.toml: general isula-builder configuration file, which is used to set the isula-builder log level, persistency directory, runtime directory, and OCI runtime. Parameters in the configuration file are described as follows:

| Configuration Item    | Mandatory or Optional | Description                         | Value                         |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| debug | Optional | Indicates whether to enable the debug log function. | true: Enable the debug log function. false: Disable the debug log function. |
| loglevel | Optional | Sets the log level.          | debug<br/>info<br/>warn<br/>error                |
| run_root | Mandatory | Sets the root directory of runtime data. | For example, /var/run/isula-build/ |
| data_root | Mandatory | Sets the local persistency directory. | For example, /var/lib/isula-build/ |
| runtime | Optional | Sets the runtime type. Currently, only runc is supported. | runc                                            |
| group | Optional | Sets an owner group for the local socket file isula_build.sock so that non-privileged users in the group can use isula-build. | isula |
| experimental | Optional | Indicates whether to enable experimental features. | true: Enable experimental features. false: Disable experimental features. |

- /etc/isula-build/storage.toml: configuration file for local persistent storage, including the configuration of the storage driver in use.

| Configuration Item    | Mandatory or Optional | Description                         |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| driver | Optional | Storage driver type. Currently, overlay2 is supported. |

  For more settings, see [containers-storage.conf.5.md](https://github.com/containers/storage/blob/master/docs/containers-storage.conf.5.md).


- /etc/isula-build/registries.toml: configuration file for each image repository.

| Configuration Item    | Mandatory or Optional | Description                         |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| registries.search | Optional | Search domain of the image repository. Only listed image repositories can be found. |
| registries.insecure | Optional | Accessible insecure image repositories. Listed image repositories cannot pass the authentication and are not recommended. |

  For more settings, see [containers-registries.conf.5.md](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md).

- /etc/isula-build/policy.json: image pull/push policy file. Note: Currently, this parameter cannot be configured.

> **Note:**
>
> - isula-build supports the preceding configuration file with the maximum size of 1 MiB.
> - The persistent working directory dataroot cannot be configured on the memory disk, for example, tmpfs.
> - Currently, only overlay2 can be used as the underlying graphdriver.
> - Before setting the --group option, ensure that the corresponding user group has been created on a local OS and non-privileged users have been added to the group. After the isula-builder is restarted, non-privileged users can use the isula-build function. In addition, to ensure permission consistency, the array of the isula-build configuration file directory /etc/isula-build is set to the group specified by --group.

### Managing the isula-build Service

Currently, openEuler uses systemd to manage the isula-build service. The isula-build software package contains the systemd service file. After installing the isula-build software package, you can use the systemd tool to start or stop the isula-build service. You can also manually start the isula-builder software. Note that only one isula-builder process can be started on a node at a time.

> **Note:**
>
> - Only one isula-builder process can be started on a node at a time.

#### (Recommended) Using systemd for Management

You can run the following systemd commands to start, stop, and restart the isula-build service:

- Run the following command to start the isula-build service:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl start isula-build.service
  ```

- Run the following command to stop the isula-build service:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl stop isula-build.service
  ```

- Run the following command to restart the isula-builder service:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart isula-build.service
  ```

The systemd service file of the isula-build software installation package is stored in the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/isula-build.service` directory. If you need to modify the systemd configuration of the isula-build service, modify the file and run the following command to make the modification take effect. Then restart the isula-build service based on the systemd management command.

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

#### Directly Running isula-builder

You can also run the isula-builder command on the server to start the service. The isula-builder command can contain flags for service startup. The following flags are supported:

- -D, --debug: whether to enable the debugging mode.
- --log-level: log level. The options are debug, info, warn, and error. The default value is info.
- --dataroot: local persistency directory. The default value is /var/lib/isula-build/.
- --runroot: runtime directory. The default value is /var/run/isula-build/.
- --storage-driver: underlying storage driver type.
- --storage-opt: underlying storage driver configuration.
- --group: an owner group for the local socket file isula_build.sock so that non-privileged users in the group can use isula-build. The default owner group is "isula".
- --experimental: whether to enable experimental features.

> **Note:**
>
> - If the command line startup parameters contain the same configuration options as those in the configuration file, the command line parameters are preferentially used for startup.

Start the isula-build service. For example, to specify the local persistency directory /var/lib/isula-build and disable debugging, run the following command:

```sh
sudo isula-builder --dataroot "/var/lib/isula-build" --debug=false
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Prerequisites

isula-build depends on the executable file runc to build the RUN command in the Dockerfile. Therefore, the runc must be pre-installed in the running environment of isula-build. The installation method depends on the application scenario. If you do not need to use the complete docker-engine tool chain, you can install only the docker-runc RPM package.

```sh
sudo yum install -y docker-runc
```

> **Note:**
>
> - On some openEuler software repositories, the package name docker-runc has been changed to runc. You need to run `sudo yum install -y runc` to install it.

If you need to use a complete docker-engine tool chain, install the docker-engine RPM package, which contains the executable file runc by default.

```sh
sudo yum install -y docker-engine
```

> **Note:**
>
> - Users must ensure the security of OCI runtime (runc) executable files to prevent malicious replacement.

### Overview

The isula-build client provides a series of commands for building and managing container images. Currently, the isula-build client provides the following command lines:

- ctr-img: manages container images. The ctr-img command contains the following subcommands:
  - build: builds a container image based on the specified Dockerfile.
  - images: lists local container images.
  - import: imports a basic container image.
  - load: imports a cascade image.
  - rm: deletes a local container image.
  - save: exports a cascade image to a local disk.
  - tag: adds a tag to a local container image.
  - pull: pulls an image to a local host.
  - push: pushes a local image to a remote repository.
- info: displays the running environment and system information of isula-build.
- login: logs in to the remote container image repository.
- logout: logs out of the remote container image repository.
- version: displays the versions of isula-build and isula-builder.
- manifest(experimental feature): manage manifest list.

> **Note:**
>
> - The isula-build completion and isula-builder completion commands are used to generate the bash command completion script. This command is implicitly provided by the command line framework and is not displayed in the help information.
> - isula-build client does not have any configuration file. When users want to use isula-build experimental features, they need to enable the environment variable ISULABUILD_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL on the client by command `export ISULABUILD_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL=enabled`.

The following describes how to use these commands in detail.


### ctr-img: Container Image Management

The isula-build command groups all container image management commands into the `ctr-img` command. The command is as follows:

```
isula-build ctr-img [command]
```

#### build: Container Image Build

The subcommand build of the ctr-img command is used to build container images. The command is as follows:

```
isula-build ctr-img build [flags]
```

The build command contains the following flags:

- --build-arg: string list, which contains variables required during the build process.
- --build-static: key value, which is used to build binary equivalence. Currently, the following key values are included:
   - build-time: string, which indicates that a fixed timestamp is used to build a container image. The timestamp format is YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS.
- -f, --filename: string, which indicates the path of the Dockerfiles. If this parameter is not specified, the current path is used.
- --format: string, which indicates the image format: oci | docker (ISULABUILD_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL needed to be enabled).
- --iidfile: string, which indicates the ID of the image output to a local file.
- -o, --output: string, which indicates the image export mode and path.
- --proxy: Boolean, which inherits the proxy environment variable on the host. The default value is true.
- --tag: string, which indicates the tag value of the image that is successfully built.
- --cap-add: string list, which contains permissions required by the RUN command during the build process.

** The following describes the flags in detail. **

**\--build-arg**

Parameters in the Dockerfile are inherited from the command lines. The usage is as follows:

```sh
$ echo "This is bar file" > bar.txt
$ cat Dockerfile_arg
FROM busybox
ARG foo
ADD ${foo}.txt .
RUN cat ${foo}.txt
$ sudo isula-build ctr-img build --build-arg foo=bar -f Dockerfile_arg

```

**\--build-static**

Specifies a static build. That is, when isula-build is used to build a container image, differences between all timestamps and other build factors (such as the container ID and hostname) are eliminated. Finally, a container image that meets the static requirements is built.

When isula-build is used to build a container image, assume that a fixed timestamp is given to the build subcommand and the following conditions are met:

- The build environment is consistent before and after the upgrade.
- The Dockerfile is consistent before and after the build.
- The intermediate data generated before and after the build is consistent.
- The build commands are the same.
- The versions of the third-party libraries are the same.

For container image build, isula-build supports the same Dockerfile. If the build environments are the same, the image content and image ID generated in multiple builds are the same.

--build-static supports the key-value pair option in the k=v format. Currently, the following options are supported:

- build-time: string, which indicates the fixed timestamp for creating a static image. The value is in the format of YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS. The timestamp affects the attribute of the file for creating and modifying the time at the diff layer.

  Example:

  ```sh
  $ sudo isula-build ctr-img build -f Dockerfile --build-static='build-time=2020-05-23 10:55:33' .
  ```

  In this way, the container images and image IDs built in the same environment for multiple times are the same.

**\--format**
This option can be used when opening the experiment feature, and OCI image format will taken as the default image format. You can choose corresponding image format for building, for example, building oci image format image and docker image format image are listed below.
  ```sh
  $ export ISULABUILD_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL=enabled; sudo isula-build ctr-img build -f Dockerfile --format oci .
  ```

  ```sh
  $ export ISULABUILD_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL=enabled; sudo isula-build ctr-img build -f Dockerfile --format docker .
  ```

**\--iidfile**

Run the following command to output the ID of the built image to a file:

```
isula-build ctr-img build --iidfile filename
```

For example, to export the container image ID to the testfile file, run the following command:

  ```sh
$ sudo isula-build ctr-img build -f Dockerfile_arg --iidfile testfile
  ```

  Check the container image ID in the testfile file.

  ```sh
$ cat testfile
76cbeed38a8e716e22b68988a76410eaf83327963c3b29ff648296d5cd15ce7b
  ```

**\-o, --output**

Currently, -o and --output support the following formats:

- `isulad:image:tag`: directly pushes the image that is successfully built to iSulad, for example, `-o isulad:busybox:latest`. Pay attention to the following restrictions:

  - isula-build and iSulad must be on the same node.
  - The tag must be configured.
  - On the isula-build client, you need to temporarily save the successfully built image as `/var/tmp/isula-build-tmp-%v.tar` and then import it to iSulad. Ensure that the `/var/tmp/` directory has sufficient disk space.

- `docker-daemon:image:tag`: directly pushes the successfully built image to Docker daemon, for example, `-o docker-daemon:busybox:latest`. Pay attention to the following restrictions:
- isula-build and Docker must be on the same node.
  - The tag must be configured.

- `docker://registry.example.com/repository:tag`: directly pushes the successfully built image to the remote image repository in Docker image format, for example, `-o docker://localhost:5000/library/busybox:latest`.


- `docker-archive:<path>/<filename>:image:tag`: saves the successfully built image to the local host in Docker image format, for example, `-o docker-archive:/root/image.tar:busybox:latest`.

When experiment feature is enabled, you can build image in OCI image format with:
- `oci://registry.example.com/repository:tag`: directly pushes the successfully built image to the remote image repository in OCI image format(OCI image format should be supported by the remote repository), for example, `-o oci://localhost:5000/library/busybox:latest`.

- `oci-archive:<path>/<filename>:image:tag`: saves the successfully built image to the local host in OCI image format, for example, `-o oci-archive:/root/image.tar:busybox:latest`.


In addition to flags, the build subcommand also supports an argument whose type is string and meaning is context, that is, the context of the Dockerfile build environment. The default value of this parameter is the current path where isula-build is executed. This path affects the path retrieved by the ADD and COPY commands of .dockerignore and Dockerfile.

**\--proxy**

Specifies whether the container started by the RUN command inherits the proxy-related environment variables http_proxy, https_proxy, ftp_proxy, no_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, and FTP_PROXY. The default value of NO_PROXY is true.

When a user configures proxy-related ARG or ENV in the Dockerfile, the inherited environment variables will be overwritten.

> **Note:**
>
> - If the client and daemon are not running on the same terminal, the environment variables that can be inherited are the environment variables of the terminal where the daemon is located.

**\--tag**

Specifies the tag of the image stored on the local disk after the image is successfully built.

**\--cap-add**

Run the following command to add the permission required by the RUN command during the build process:

```
isula-build ctr-img build --cap-add ${CAP}
```

Example:

```sh
$ sudo isula-build ctr-img build --cap-add CAP_SYS_ADMIN --cap-add CAP_SYS_PTRACE -f Dockerfile
```

> **Note:**
>
> - A maximum of 100 container images can be concurrently built.
> - isula-build supports Dockerfiles with a maximum size of 1 MiB.
> - isula-build supports the .dockerignore file with a maximum size of 1 MiB.
> - Ensure that only the current user has the read and write permissions on the Dockerfiles to prevent other users from tampering with the files.
> - During the build, the RUN command starts the container to build in the container. Currently, isula-build supports the host network only.
> - isula-build only supports the tar compression format.
> - isula-build commits once after each image build stage is complete, instead of each time a Dockerfile line is executed.
> - isula-build does not support cache build.
> - isula-build starts the build container only when the RUN command is built.
> - Currently, the history function of Docker images is not supported.
> - The stage name can start with a digit.
> - The stage name can contain a maximum of 64 characters.
> - isula-build does not support resource restriction on a single Dockerfile build. If resource restriction is required, you can configure a resource limit on the isula-builder.
> - Currently, isula-build does not support a remote URL as the data source of the ADD command in the Dockerfile.
> - The local tarball exported using the 'docker-archive' and 'oci-archive' type are not compressed, you can manually compress the file as required.

#### image: Viewing Local Persistent Build Images

You can run the images command to view the images in the local persistent storage.

```sh
$ sudo isula-build ctr-img images
---------------------------------------  -----------  -----------------  ------------------------  ------------
REPOSITORY                               TAG          IMAGE ID           CREATED                   SIZE
---------------------------------------  -----------  -----------------  ------------------------  ------------

---------------------------------------  -----------  -----------------  ------------------------  ------------
```

> **Note:**
>
> - The image size displayed by running the `isula-build ctr-img images` command may be different from that displayed by running the `docker images` command. When calculating the image size, isula-build directly calculates the total size of .tar packages at each layer, while Docker calculates the total size of files by decompressing the .tar package and traversing the diff directory. Therefore, the statistics are different.

#### import: Importing a Basic Container Image

A tar file in rootfs form can be imported into isula-build via the `ctr-img import` command.

The command is as follows:

```
isula-build ctr-img import FILE [REPOSITORY[:TAG]]
```

Example:

```sh
$ sudo isula-build ctr-img import busybox.tar mybusybox:latest

---------------------------------------  -----------  -----------------  ------------------------  ------------
```

> **Note:**
>
> - isula-build supports the import of container basic images with a maximum size of 1 GiB.
> - isula-build does not support concurrent import of the same basic container image.

#### load: Importing Cascade Images

Cascade images are images that are saved to the local computer by running the docker save or isula-build ctr-img save command. The compressed image package contains a layer-by-layer image package named layer.tar. You can run the ctr-img load command to import the image to isula-build.

The command is as follows:

```
isula-build ctr-img load [flags]
```

Currently, the following flags are supported:

- -i, --input: path of the local .tar package.

Example:

```sh

#### load: Importing Separated Images

The isula-build ctr-img load command is used to assemble a complete image that is exported by layer and load the image to the system.

The command prototype is as follows:

```
isula-build ctr-img load -d IMAGES_DIR [-b BASE_IMAGE] [-l LIB_IMAGE] -i APP_IMAGE
```

IMAGE: name of the application image to be imported: TAG (it cannot be the image ID).

The following Flags are supported:

- -d: Specifies the folder where the application layer image is stored. This parameter is mandatory. The folder contains at least the app image and complete manifest file. You can store the files at the base layer and lib layer separately and specify them by using the -b and -l parameters.
- -b: specifies the path of the image at the base layer. This parameter is optional. If this parameter is not specified, the path specified by -d is used by default.
- -l: specifies the path of the image at the lib layer. This parameter is optional. If this parameter is not specified, the path specified by -d is used by default.
- -i: Specifies the name of the application image to be imported. This parameter is mandatory.
- –no-check: skips SHA256 verification. This parameter is optional.

> **Note:**
>
> - You need to enter the image name parameter. The value of Image_NAME:TAG must be used to specify a unique image. If Image_ID is used or no tag is added, multiple images may be mapped, or the same image may have different IDs during the import and export process. As a result, the execution result deviates from the user's expectation.
> - When -no-check is used, the sha256 checksum of the tarball is skipped. Abandoning the checksum checksum check on tarballs may introduce uncertainties. Users need to be clear and accept the possible impact and consequences of such actions.
> - The capacity of the isula-build running directory /var/lib/isula-build/ must be at least twice the total size of the tiered mirror. If you want to store images A (10 MB), B (20 MB), and C (30 MB), ensure that the size of the disk where /var/lib/isula-build resides is 120 MB (2 x (10 + 20 + 30)).
> - When a hierarchical image is saved or loaded, the file needs to be read into the memory when the SHA256 value of the file is calculated. Therefore, linear memory consumption occurs when concurrent operations are performed.

#### rm: Deleting a Local Persistent Image

You can run the rm command to delete an image from the local persistent storage. The command is as follows:

```
isula-build ctr-img rm IMAGE [IMAGE...] [FLAGS]
```

Currently, the following flags are supported:

- -a, --all: deletes all images stored locally.
- -p, --prune: deletes all images that are stored locally and do not have tags.

Example:

```sh
$ sudo isula-build ctr-img rm -p
Deleted: sha256:78731c1dde25361f539555edaf8f0b24132085b7cab6ecb90de63d72fa00c01d
Deleted: sha256:eeba1bfe9fca569a894d525ed291bdaef389d28a88c288914c1a9db7261ad12c
```

#### save: Exporting Cascade Images

You can run the save command to export the cascade images to the local disk. The command is as follows:

```
isula-build ctr-img save [REPOSITORY:TAG]|imageID -o xx.tar
```

Currently, the following flags are supported:

- -f, --format: which indicates the exported image format: oci | docker (ISULABUILD_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL needed to be enabled)
- -o, --output: which indicates the local path for storing the exported images.

The following example shows how to export an image in `image/tag` format:

```sh
$ sudo isula-build ctr-img save busybox:latest -o busybox.tar

#### save: Exporting Separated Images

The isula-build ctr-img save command can be used to export base/lib/app layers. If multiple application layers depend on the same base and lib, only one copy is exported. If -d is not used to specify the destination directory, the exported base/lib/app image package is saved in the Imagesimages directory.

The command prototype is as follows:

```
isula-build ctr-img save -b BASE_IMAGE:TAG [-l LIB_IMAGE:TAG] [-r rename.json] [ -d DST_DIR] IMAGE [IMAGE…]
```

IMAGE: name of the application image to be exported: TAG (it cannot be the image ID). You can export multiple application images with the same base/lib at the same time.

The following Flags are supported:

- -b, --base: mandatory. Specifies the image tag at the base layer, for example, euleros:latest. This parameter is mandatory. It is used to check whether the base image is the same as the base image in the app. The image name can contain a maximum of 255 characters (a-z0-9-*./). The tag name can contain a maximum of 128 characters (same as Docker).
- -l, --lib: optional. Specifies the image at the lib layer, for example, euleros:libfoo. This parameter is optional. If there is no lib layer in actual applications, this parameter is optional.

- -d: This parameter is optional. This parameter is mandatory to ensure that the directory for storing hierarchical images obtained by concurrent processes does not conflict. Specifies the directory for saving the exported results. The directory must be empty. If save is executed concurrently, ensure that the directory name is unique. Otherwise, the saved image may be incomplete or incorrect.

- -r: specifies the name description file of the exported image .tar package. The file is in JSON format. If this parameter is not specified, the name of the exported app-layer image is "ImageName_tag_app_image.tar.gz" by default. The default image at the lib layer is "ImageName_tag_lib_image.tar.gz". The default value of the Base layer image is "ImageName_tag_base_image.tar.gz".

If you need to rename the file, create the corresponding JSON file as prompted. The format of the JSON file is as follows:

```
[ 
    { "name": "repo_tag_app_image.tar.gz", 
      "rename": "some_app_image.tar.gz" 
    } 
    …
]
```

> **Note:**
>
> - When saving a hierarchical image, specify the image name instead of the image ID. Otherwise, an error will be reported.
> - When saving a layered image, ensure that the base image has only one layer and -b must specify an image.
> - When saving a hierarchical image, you need to specify the directory (-d) for storing the hierarchical image. If this directory is not specified, the Images folder in the current directory is used.
> - When saving a layered image, ensure that the directory for storing the layered image is empty. Otherwise, an error is reported.
> - A manifest file is generated when a layered image is saved. The manifest file records the name and sha256sum of the compressed package of each layered image. During loading, the sha256sum of each compressed package is verified to prevent incorrect use.
> - If the lib layer is not available in the actual application scenario, you do not need to add the -l parameter.
> - The app image must be the same as the base/lib image.
> - You need to enter the image name parameter. The value of Image_NAME:TAG must be used to specify a unique image. If Image_ID is used or no tag is added, multiple images may be mapped, or the same image may have different IDs during the import and export process. As a result, the execution result deviates from the user's expectation.
> - When multiple images are layered, if these images have the same lib layer, specify the name of the lib layer image. Otherwise, the saving fails.
> - The capacity of the isula-build running directory /var/lib/isula-build/ must be at least twice the total size of the tiered mirror. If you want to store images A (10 MB), B (20 MB), and C (30 MB), ensure that the size of the disk where /var/lib/isula-build resides is 120 MB (2 x (10 + 20 + 30)).
> - When a hierarchical image is saved or loaded, the file needs to be read into the memory when the SHA256 value of the file is calculated. Therefore, linear memory consumption occurs when concurrent operations are performed.

#### tag: Tagging Local Persistent Images

You can run the tag command to add a tag to a local persistent container image. The command is as follows:

```
isula-build ctr-img tag <imageID>/<imageName> busybox:latest
```

Example:

```sh
$ sudo isula-build ctr-img images
---------------------------------------  -----------  -----------------  --------------------------  ------------
REPOSITORY                               TAG          IMAGE ID           CREATED                     SIZE

```

### manifest: Manifest List Management

The manifest list contains the image information corresponding to different system architectures. You can use the same manifest (for example, openeuler:latest) in different architectures to obtain the image of the corresponding architecture. The manifest contains the create, annotate, inspect, and push subcommands.

> **NOTE:**
>
> - manifest is an experiment feature. When using this feature, you need to enable the experiment options on the client and server. For details, see Client Overview and Configuring Services.

#### create: Manifest List Creation

The create subcommand of the manifest command is used to create a manifest list. The command prototype is as follows:

```
isula-build manifest create MANIFEST_LIST MANIFEST [MANIFEST...]
```

You can specify the name of the manifest list and the remote images to be added to the list. If no remote image is specified, an empty manifest list is created.

Example:

```sh
$ sudo isula-build manifest create openeuler localhost:5000/openeuler_x86:latest localhost:5000/openeuler_aarch64:latest
```

#### annotate: Manifest List Update

The annotate subcommand of the manifest command is used to update the manifest list. The command prototype is as follows:

```
isula-build manifest annotate MANIFEST_LIST MANIFEST [flags]
```

You can specify the manifest list to be updated and the images in the manifest list, and use flags to specify the options to be updated. This command can also be used to add new images to the manifest list.

Currently, the following flags are supported:

- --arch: Applicable architecture of the rewritten image. The value is a string.
- --os: Indicates the applicable system of the image. The value is a string.
- --os-features: Specifies the OS features required by the image. This parameter is a string and rarely used.
- --variant: Variable of the image recorded in the list. The value is a string.

Example:

```sh
$ sudo isula-build manifest annotate --os linux --arch arm64 openeuler:latest localhost:5000/openeuler_aarch64:latest
```

#### inspect: Manifest List Inspect

The inspect subcommand of the manifest command is used to query the manifest list. The command prototype is as follows:

```
isula-build manifest inspect MANIFEST_LIST
```

Example:

```sh
$ sudo isula-build manifest inspect openeuler:latest
{
    "schemaVersion": 2,
    "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json",
    "manifests": [
        {
            "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
            "size": 527,
            "digest": "sha256:bf510723d2cd2d4e3f5ce7e93bf1e52c8fd76831995ac3bd3f90ecc866643aff",
            "platform": {
                "architecture": "amd64",
                "os": "linux"
            }
        },
        {
            "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
            "size": 527,
            "digest": "sha256:f814888b4bb6149bd39ba8375a1932fb15071b4dbffc7f76c7b602b06abbb820",
            "platform": {
                "architecture": "arm64",
                "os": "linux"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### push: Manifest List Push to the Remote Repository.

The manifest subcommand push is used to push the manifest list to the remote repository. The command prototype is as follows:

```
isula-build manifest push MANIFEST_LIST DESTINATION
```

Example:

```sh
$ sudo isula-build manifest push openeuler:latest localhost:5000/openeuler:latest
```

## Directly Integrating a Container Engine

isula-build can be integrated with iSulad or Docker to import the built container image to the local storage of the container engine.

### Integration with iSulad

Images that are successfully built can be directly exported to the iSulad.

Example:

```sh
$ sudo isula-build ctr-img build -f Dockerfile -o isulad:busybox:2.0
```

Specify iSulad in the -o parameter to export the built container image to iSulad. You can query the image using isula images.

```sh
$ sudo isula images
isula images
REPOSITORY                     TAG        IMAGE ID             CREATED              SIZE
busybox                        2.0        2d414a5cad6d         2020-08-01 06:41:36  5.577 MB
```

> **Note:**
>
> - It is required that isula-build and iSulad be on the same node.
> - When an image is directly exported to the iSulad, the isula-build client needs to temporarily store the successfully built image as `/var/lib/isula-build/tmp/[buildid]/isula-build-tmp-%v.tar` and then import it to the iSulad. Ensure that the /var/tmp/ directory has sufficient disk space. If the isula-build client process is killed or Ctrl+C is pressed during the export, you need to manually clear the `/var/lib/isula-build/tmp/[buildid]/isula-build-tmp-%v.tar` file.

### Integration with Docker

Images that are successfully built can be directly exported to the Docker daemon.

Example:

```sh
$ sudo isula-build ctr-img build -f Dockerfile -o docker-daemon:busybox:2.0
```

Specify docker-daemon in the -o parameter to export the built container image to Docker. You can run the docker images command to query the image.

```sh
$ sudo docker images
REPOSITORY                                          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
busybox                                             2.0                 2d414a5cad6d        2 months ago        5.22MB
```

> **Note:**
>
> - The isula-build and Docker must be on the same node.

## Precautions
This chapter is something about constraints, limitations and differences with `docker build` when use isula-builder build images.

### Constraints or Limitations
1. When export an image to [`iSulad`](https://gitee.com/openeuler/iSulad/blob/master/README.md), a tag is necessary.
2. Because oci runtime binary will be called by `isula-builder` when executing `RUN` command, the integrity of the runtime binary should be guaranteed by the user.
3. DataRoot should not be set in tmpfs.
4. `Overlay2` is the only storage driver supported by isula-builder currently.
5. Docker image is the only image format supported by isula-builder currently.
6. File permission of Dockerfile is strongly recommended to restrict as 0600, avoiding tampering by other users.
7. Only host network is supported by `RUN` command currently.
8. When export image to a tarball, only `tar` compression format supported by isula-builder currently.
9. The base image tarball szie is limited to 1G when import a base image to the store.


###  Differences with "docker build"
The `isula-build` compatible with [Dockerfile specification](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder), but there are also some subtle differences between `isula-builder` and `docker build` are as follows:
1. Commit every build stage, but not every line.
2. Build cache is not supported by isula-builder.
3. Only `RUN` command will be executed in the build container.
4. Build history is not supported currently.
5. Stage name can be start with a number.
6. The length of the stage name is limited to 64 in `isula-builder`.
7. `ADD` command's source can not support remote URL currently.
8. Not support resource quota for a single build request, but you can limit the `isula-builder` instead.
9. `isula-builder` add each origin layer tar size to get the image size, but docker only uses the diff content of each layer. So the image size listed by `isula-builder images` is a little different.
10. Image name should be the format **NAME:TAG**. For example `busybox:latest`, the `latest` should not be ommitted.
